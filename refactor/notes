Basic design:

I: MODEL
    WorldModel -- overall model iterface; this is what the UI interacts with.
        WorldMap -- Interface into just the map of the world.
        MapSlice -- Part of the map; a two dimensional flat plan, used for UI
        MapLocation -- Specific point on the map

        GameSystem -- Generic interface that WorldModel uses to update all systems
            PhysicalModel -- Kinematic model of game engine objects
            ThermalModel -- Temperature mode of terrain and game objects
            WeatherModel -- Background weather; affects thermal model among other things

UserInterface -- Interface to the thing that does user IO
